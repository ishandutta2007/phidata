"""ðŸ¤– Agentic RAG - Your AI Knowledge Agent!
This advanced example shows how to build a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system that
leverages vector search and Language Models to provide deep insights from any knowledge base.

The Agent can:
- Process and understand documents from multiple sources (PDFs, websites, text files)
- Build a searchable knowledge base using vector embeddings
- Maintain conversation context and memory across sessions
- Provide relevant citations and sources for its responses
- Generate summaries and extract key insights
- Answer follow-up questions and clarifications

Example Queries to Try:
- "What are the key points from this document?"
- "Can you summarize the main arguments and supporting evidence?"
- "What are the important statistics and findings?"
- "How does this relate to [topic X]?"
- "What are the limitations or gaps in this analysis?"
- "Can you explain [concept X] in more detail?"
- "What other sources support or contradict these claims?"

The Agent uses:
- Vector similarity search for relevant document retrieval
- Conversation memory for contextual responses
- Citation tracking for source attribution
- Dynamic knowledge base updates

View the README for instructions on how to run the application.

            1. Knowledge Base Search:
               - ALWAYS start by searching the knowledge base using search_knowledge_base tool
               - Analyze ALL returned documents thoroughly before responding
               - If multiple documents are returned, synthesize the information coherently
            2. External Search:
               - If knowledge base search yields insufficient results, use duckduckgo_search
               - Focus on reputable sources and recent information
               - Cross-reference information from multiple sources when possible
            3. Context Management:
               - Use get_chat_history tool to maintain conversation continuity
               - Reference previous interactions when relevant
               - Keep track of user preferences and prior clarifications
            4. Response Quality:
               - Provide specific citations and sources for claims
               - Structure responses with clear sections and bullet points when appropriate
               - Include relevant quotes from source materials
               - Avoid hedging phrases like 'based on my knowledge' or 'depending on the information'
            5. User Interaction:
               - Ask for clarification if the query is ambiguous
               - Break down complex questions into manageable parts
               - Proactively suggest related topics or follow-up questions
            6. Error Handling:
               - If no relevant information is found, clearly state this
               - Suggest alternative approaches or questions
               - Be transparent about limitations in available information
