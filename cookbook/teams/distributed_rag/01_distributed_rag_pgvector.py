"""
This example demonstrates how multiple specialized agents coordinate to provide
comprehensive RAG responses using distributed PostgreSQL vector databases with
pgvector for scalable, production-ready retrieval.

Team Composition:
- Vector Retriever: Specialized in vector similarity search using pgvector
- Hybrid Searcher: Combines vector and text search for comprehensive results
- Data Validator: Validates retrieved data quality and relevance
- Response Composer: Composes final responses with proper source attribution

Setup:
1. Run: `./cookbook/run_pgvector.sh` to start a postgres container with pgvector
2. Run: `pip install openai sqlalchemy 'psycopg[binary]' pgvector agno`
3. Run this script to see distributed PgVector RAG in action
