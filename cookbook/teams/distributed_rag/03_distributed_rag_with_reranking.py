"""
This example demonstrates how multiple specialized agents coordinate to provide
comprehensive RAG responses using advanced reranking strategies for optimal
information retrieval and synthesis.

Team Composition:
- Initial Retriever: Performs broad initial retrieval from knowledge base
- Reranking Specialist: Applies advanced reranking for result optimization
- Context Analyzer: Analyzes context and relevance of reranked results
- Final Synthesizer: Synthesizes reranked results into optimal responses

Setup:
1. Run: `pip install openai lancedb tantivy pypdf sqlalchemy agno`
2. Run this script to see advanced reranking RAG in action
